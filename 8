    Hi there! I’m Jasmine Liu, a Computer Science student at Temple University with a creative twist—I'm also minoring in Art. This is my second summer working at the bank, where I’ve been honing my tech skills and exploring the exciting world of Angular. I created this application as a personal challenge to master the Angular framework, and it's been a blast! As I build this project, I’m not just learning—I’m also ready to teach and share the knowledge with others. Let’s code, create, and have some fun along the way!

Angular Validators are built-in functions used in reactive forms to ensure that form inputs meet specific requirements. They provide a way to validate form controls by checking conditions like required fields, minimum or maximum lengths, patterns, and more. Validators can be applied individually or combined to enforce multiple rules on a single form control. Angular also allows you to create custom validators to handle more complex validation scenarios tailored to your application's needs. Using validators ensures that data entered into forms is consistent and meets the expected criteria before submission.
