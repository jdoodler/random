    Hi there! I’m Jasmine Liu, a Computer Science student at Temple University with a creative twist—I'm also minoring in Art. This is my second summer working at the bank, where I’ve been honing my tech skills and exploring the exciting world of Angular. I created this application as a personal challenge to master the Angular framework, and it's been a blast! As I build this project, I’m not just learning—I’m also ready to teach and share the knowledge with others. Let’s code, create, and have some fun along the way!
